		<h2>Checkendon Pre School</h2>
		<p>Located alongside Checkendon Church of England Primary School and set in the heart
		of the rolling hills of the South Chilterns, we offer a friendly and varied environment 
		in which your child will develop and learn through play. We are based in the village hall which has recently undergone refurbishment to allow us a light, bright, spacious environment which we can adapt to our needs. Our large range of equipment is updated regularly to offer the children modern, safe, yet traditional resources enabling them all to reach their full potential through their play and the activities provided.</p>
		<p>Our location affords us easy access to further facilities such as Checkendon Primary's
		spacious outdoor learning areas.  Additionally, the children enjoy outdoor
		adventures through local woodland and fields allowing the opportunity to learn about
		the natural world and local environment.  
		</p>
		<p>We welcome children from the age of 2 years, including those in nappies.</P>
		<p>Our experienced, qualified staff deliver the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), the principle
		of which is that 'Every child is a competent learner from birth who can be resilient, capable, 
		confident and self-assured'.  Our safe, secure environment enables each child to engage in 
		diverse learning and development opportunities.</p>
		<p>The children’s broad learning experience at Checkendon Pre-School includes cooking activities, French, P.E, music and dance, creative activities as well as topically themed visits from external educational organisations such as “Zoolab”. Each year we hold a Sports Day, Bike week, Easter Bonnet Parade, Nativity and so much more. There is always an exciting event to look forward to at Checkendon Pre-School involving our families and friends.</p>
