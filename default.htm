		<h2>Checkendon Pre School</h2>
		<p>Checkendon Pre School CIO is a long-established pre school helping children from 2 years of age (including those in nappies) to learn, develop and make friends. A safe, secure and stimulating environment for your child, where we will help and advise you on how your child can grow; offering OFSTED approved, high quality early years education from 7.30am to 3.30pm, five days a week.</p>
 		<p>Set in an idyllic village hall in the heart of the South Oxfordshire Countryside, we take full advantage of the local woodlands, large playing fields and allotment space that we have at the local Primary School.</p>
 		<p>We believe every child has a right to reach their full potential and we strive to ensure all our activities build on their confidence, expand on their social skills and increase their learning and communication.</p>
		<p>Registered for Nursery Education Funding for 2 and 3 year olds, we operate 4 sessions per days. Our Breakfast Club starts at 7.30am allowing parents that added, precious time in the morning. Breakfast Club is also open to older children so siblings can attend as well, and Checkendon Primary School pupils will be escorted to school. We offer a variety of healthy breakfast options along with a friendly and varied environment for your child to get ready for the day ahead.</p>
 		<p>Checkendon Pre School is a registered charity run by parents. The pre-school has recently transformed to a Charitable Incorporated Association which means, unlike many similar pre-schools, committee members are protected from personal financial liability. Regular meetings take place attended by the committee and staff in which all changes, improvements and decisions are discussed. The committee is always interested in new members, the pre school cannot run without one, so please if you are interested contact a member of staff. </p>
		<p>Checkendon Pre School CIO is proud to be sponsored by Warmingham Estate Agent.</p>
		<p>OFSTED Inspected, Member of Pre-School Learning Alliance Group, Charity No. 1156803.</p>
